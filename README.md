## Introduction

Maze Escape is a browser-based maze game where players navigate through a randomly generated maze to reach the exit while avoiding an enemy. The maze is generated using the Recursive Backtracker algorithm, ensuring that each maze is solvable and unique.

## Features
Random Maze Generation: Every game presents a new maze layout, providing endless replayability.
Enemy AI: An enemy moves around the maze, adding an extra challenge for the player.
Dynamic Difficulty: Choose from different maze sizes to adjust the game's difficulty.
Timer: Track how long it takes to escape the maze.
## Gameplay
Objective: Navigate from the starting position to the exit without being caught by the enemy.
Controls: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player character through the maze.
Enemy Movement: The enemy moves randomly but avoids retracing its steps immediately, making its movement less predictable.
